	DESCRIPTION
The counttexruns package counts how often a LaTeX document is compiled.

From a statistical perspective you maybe want to know how often you compiled a
document. This is exactly the task I wrote this package for. For a few years I
used a bash script and -shell-escape to do this but I decided to write this
small package to do the trick a little nicer.

To print the count you can use the macro \thecounttexruns.
